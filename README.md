# FunnyLang
 A programming language made for my friends (they made me code in Python)

## Commands

COMMANDS ARE CASE SENSITIVE
`fuck [arg]` -> push [arg]
`zamn` -> pop
`caddydaddy` -> print(stack[1])

## More brilliant features

- Just like the great language of LUA, the stack can be referenced, and indexing starts at 1.
    - Starting at 0 is for pussies!
- LITERALLY NO ERROR REPORTING!
    - Figure it out for yourself, dickface.
- Randomly decides not to run!
    - FUCK YOU, BALTIMORE!
- Made with Python, the fastest of languages!
    - Have fun.
- Every file extension is valid!
    - That is, if it can hold text data.
    - Else, GO FUCK YOURSELF!
